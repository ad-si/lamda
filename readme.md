## Features

- **Batteries included** -
    Contains apps and services for most common computing needs.

- **File based** -
    All apps are required to only store and retrieve data as (plaintext) files
    in their assigned storage directory.

- **Easily installable** -
    Download the binary, execute it, open your browser. ðŸš€

- **Effective** -
    Made for power users.
    No useless whitespace, no animations, and no other pointless baggage.

- **Innovative** -
    Rethinks several UI and UX patterns which we've taken for granted.
    (E.g. how a calendar is supposed to look like)


### Anti-Features

- **Window managment** -
    Already handled by your browser

- **Multi user features** -
    Does not include any rights management, comment, or collaboration features.
    However, can still be used by several people simultaneously
    if they want to work on a shared set of data.

## Ideas

- [ ] Browse files based on tags and not hierarchies
- [ ] List of bookmarklets which can be drag & dropped into new browsers
- [ ] Config to specify a list of directories each app is allowed to access
